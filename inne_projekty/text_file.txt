There are "iter" variants of these methods called iterkeys(), itervalues()
 and iteritems() which avoid the cost of constructing the whole list -- a
  performance win if the data is huge. However, I generally prefer the plain
   keys() and values() methods with their sensible names. In Python 3000
    revision, the need for the iterkeys() variants is going away. But these times it is not important to avoid performance
